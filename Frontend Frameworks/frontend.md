### Virtual DOM

The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory.
Then, it is synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.

- React uses the virtual DOM and renders elements only when the user will have them into his/her HTML DOM.
